# Landing Page Project
This project is for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. HTML and CSS starter code provided by Udacity.
This is a basic landing page that uses Javascript to create a NavBar dynamically and to highlight sections when scrolled. The project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Table of Contents
In this project we have:

- page HTML: index.html
- page of style: style.css
- page javascript: app.js

* [Instructions](#instructions)

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
